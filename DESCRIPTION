	Command-line tool to flashing devices by CAN-BUS.
	
	others:
	  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
	  --verbose       enable verbose output
	  --version       show program's version number and exit
	
	configuration:
	  -n NAME         interface name (default: slcan0)
	  -i {socketcan}  interface type (default: socketcan)
	  -f {hex,bin}    file format (default: hex)

	  {stm32}
	    stm32         STM32 ROM bootloader
	    
STM32 bootloader options
------------------------
	usage: canprog stm32 [-h] {write,read,erase,go,lock,unlock} ...
	
	others:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	
	commands:
	  {write,read,erase,go,lock,unlock}
	    write               write file to target memory
	    read                read target memory to file
	    erase               erase target memory
	    go                  start program application
	    lock                enable readout protection
	    unlock              disable readout protection
	    
Examples
--------

Write image.hex to device

	canprog stm32 write image.hex

Write image.bin to device at specified address

	canprog -f bin stm32 write image.bin -a 0x08000000
	
Read data from device as hex image

	canprog stm32 read dump.hex -s 0x200
	
Readout protection

	canprog stm32 lock
	
Erase device memory (first 4 segments)

	canprog stm32 erase -P 0 1 2 3
